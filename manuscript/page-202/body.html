<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">for Minerva has taught them all manner of useful arts, and they are very intelligent.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Outside the gate of the outer court there is a large garden of about four acres with a wall all round it. It is full of beautiful treesâ€”pears, pomegranates, and the most delicious apples. There are luscious figs also, and olives in full growth. The fruits never rot nor fail all the year round, neither winter nor summer, for the air is so soft that a new crop ripens before the old has dropped. Pear grows on pear, apple on apple, and fig on fig, and so also with the grapes, for there is an excellent vineyard: on the level ground of a part of this, the grapes are being made into raisins; in another part they are being gathered; some are being trodden in the wine tubs, others further on have shed their blossom and are beginning to show fruit, others again are just changing colour. In the furthest part of the ground there are beautifully arranged beds of flowers that are in bloom</p></div> </div>
