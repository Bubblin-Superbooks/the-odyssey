But the swineherd did not like sleeping away from his pigs, so he got ready to go outside, and Ulysses was glad to see that he looked after his property during his master's absence.

Thus equipped he went to his rest where the pigs were camping under an overhanging rock that gave them shelter from the North wind.</p></div> </div>
