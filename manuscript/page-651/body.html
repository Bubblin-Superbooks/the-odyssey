There they cut off his nose and his ears; they drew out his vitals and gave them to the dogs raw, and then in their fury they cut off his hands and his feet.</p><p>When they had done this they washed their hands and feet and went back into the house, for all was now over; and Ulysses said to the dear old nurse Euryclea, "Bring me sulphur, which cleanses all pollution, and fetch fire also that I may burn it, and purify the cloisters. Go, moreover, and tell Penelope to come here with her attendants, and also all the maidservants that are in the house."</p><p>"All that you have said is true," answered Euryclea, "but let me bring you some clean clothesâ€”a shirt and cloak. Do not keep these rags on your back any longer. It is not right."</p><p>"First light me a fire," replied Ulysses.</p></div> </div>
